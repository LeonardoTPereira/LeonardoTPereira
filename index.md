I'm Leo, a Brazilian PhD candidate and associate professor in Computer Sciences, both at [Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/) from [Universidade de São Paulo](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidade-de-sao-paulo), in Brazil.

I'm also an [indie game developer](https://leotpereira.itch.io/) on my spare time (at least when I'm not playing games, watching animes or reading). Besides programming, I usually take care of pixel art and game design.

I have been programming since my first year as an undergraduate, in 2012, when I also started developing games together with the [Fellowship of the Game](https://fog-icmc.itch.io/)
group from ICMC-USP and some friends. I began researching on procedural content generation, AI in games and other game-related topics in 2013,
which motivated me to pursue my [Master's degree](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/55/55134/tde-25032019-144917/en.php) and now my PhD.

I'll talk a little about me on this site, in case somebody may be interested &#128512;

## Research Projects

By the beginning of 2022, I have already published with my colleagues 3 papers on international journals, 6 full papers on conferences, 3 short papers and 1 paper in a national journal. I've also been an advisor for the final paper of 4 undergraduates.

My current main line of research is Procedural Content Generation for games. More specifically, the generation of multiple creative facets and how to adapt them to different types of players. However, I like to research and advise students in other game-related areas, like the generation of adaptive AI in games and serious games. I'll present a summary of my researches:

I've started researching on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) applied to path-planing in robots with my advisor [Claudio Toledo](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=oiW7E1IAAAAJ&hl=en), but a few months later had the opportunity to start working on [EAs applied to the generation of scripts in Bos Wars](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2598394.2598489), a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game, from the likes of StarCraft, developed in C++ with a Java interface for injecting code.

Shortly after, I worked with Claudio's masters student (at the time) [Lucas Ferreira](http://www.lucasnferreira.com/) in [generating procedural levels with enemy and item placement in a Super Mario Bros clone](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2598394.2598489) in Java, also using EAs.

Then, for my final paper in the undergraduate course, I studied Machine Learning (ML) approaches to learn to classify levels from an Angry Birds clone (developed by Lucas as his [Master Thesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8082517)) as feasible or not, and [reduce the simulation time of the EA that generated the levels procedurally by skipping simulation of levels classified as unfeasible](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218213017600193).

I started my masters' studies in 2017, creating an [EA to evolve dungeons with locked-door missions for 2D Zelda-like games](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417421004504).

In 2019, I started my PhD studies, focused on the orchestration of the generation of multiple game contents and the adaptation for different player profiles. We've developed an [EA able to evolve enemies for 2D Zelda-like games](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9637547/) and many updates for our game, as well as improvements on the dungeon generation and other contents, that (hopefully) will soon be published.

The project's code, that is a continuation of my masters', is currently open in [GitHub](https://github.com/LeonardoTPereira/Overlord-Project).

During that period of my PhD, I've also acted as an advisor for the final paper of 4 undergrad students, and co-advisor of another one. One turned into a conference paper, about the [adaptive generation of characters for tabletop role playing games](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8924830/).

All my publications are in my [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leonardo-Pereira-9) and my [CV Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5875419968824213) (our CV for researchers in Brazil). Email me or send me a message if you want to ask about any of the researches &#128512;

## Game Development Projects

You can check my games in my [itch.io](https://leotpereira.itch.io/).

## Technologies, Tools and Languages

-Under Construction-

I mostly focus on developing games and my procedural content generation algorithms using Unity and the C# language. However, I have already used different programming languages and tools through my career. Here I'll list all of which I can remember.

I am very interested in studying and developing applications that have good coding practices, patterns and design. Therefore, I have been dedicating my recent years to studying Clean Code, Design Patterns, Software Architecture, Refactoring, DevOps, and other good development and operation practices.

I believe that good code matters and, more than that, I believe that to achieve the orchestration of multiple procedurally generated content, in a way that they can adapt to different players and make it viable to use in games, we need to be the best developers as possible.

The lists below summarize the topics I've learned and practiced throughout my time as an undergraduate and graduate student, be it in courses, working in student groups, personal projects, my research group and while teaching.
