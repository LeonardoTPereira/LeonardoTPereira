I'm Leo, a brazilian PhD candidate and associate professor in Computer Sciences, both at [Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/) 
from [Universidade de São Paulo](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidade-de-sao-paulo), 
in Brazil.

I'm also an [indie game developer](https://leotpereira.itch.io/) on my free time (at least when I'm not playing games, watching animes or reading). Besides programming, I usually take care of pixel art and game design.

I have been programming since my first year as an undegraduate student, in 2012, when I also started developing games together with the [Fellowship of the Game](https://fog-icmc.itch.io/) 
group from ICMC-USP and some friends. I began researching on procedural content generation, AI in games and other game-related topics in 2013, which motivated me to pursue my Master degree and now my PhD.

I'll talk a little about me on this site, in case somebody may be interested &#128512;
