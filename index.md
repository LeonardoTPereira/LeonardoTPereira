I'm Leo, a brazilian PhD candidate and associate professor in Computer Sciences, both at [Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/) from [Universidade de São Paulo](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidade-de-sao-paulo), in Brazil.

I'm also an [indie game developer](https://leotpereira.itch.io/) on my free time (at least when I'm not playing games, watching animes or reading). Besides programming, I usually take care of pixel art and game design.

I have been programming since my first year as an undegraduate student, in 2012, when I also started developing games together with the [Fellowship of the Game](https://fog-icmc.itch.io/)
group from ICMC-USP and some friends. I began researching on procedural content generation, AI in games and other game-related topics in 2013,
which motivated me to pursue my [Master degree](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/55/55134/tde-25032019-144917/en.php) and now my PhD.

I'll talk a little about me on this site, in case somebody may be interested &#128512;

## Research Projects

By the beginning of 2022, I have already published with my colleagues 3 papers on international journals, 6 full papers on conferences, 3 short papers and 1 paper in a national journal. I've also been an advisor for the final paper of 4 undergraduate students.

My current main line of research is Procedural Content Generation for games. More specifically, the generation of multiple creative facets and how to adapt them to different types of players. However, I like to research and advise students in other game-related areas, like the generation of adaptive AI in games and serious games. I'll present a summary of my researches:

I've first started researching on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) applied to path-planing in robots with my advisor [Claudio Toledo](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=oiW7E1IAAAAJ&hl=en), but a few months later had the opportunity to start working on [EAs applied to the generation of scripts in Bos Wars](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2598394.2598489), a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game, from the likes of StarCraft, developed in C++ with a Java interface for injecting code.

Shortly after, I worked with Claudio's masters student (at the time) [Lucas Ferreira](http://www.lucasnferreira.com/) in [generating procedural levels with enemy and item placement in a Super Mario Bros clone](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2598394.2598489) in Java, also using EAs.

Then, for my final paper in the undegraduate course, I studied Machine Learning (ML) approaches to learn to classify levels from an Angry Birds clone (developed by Lucas as his [Master Thesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8082517)) as feasible or not, and [reduce the simulation time of the EA that generated the levels procedurally by skipping simulation of levels classified as unfeasible](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218213017600193).
